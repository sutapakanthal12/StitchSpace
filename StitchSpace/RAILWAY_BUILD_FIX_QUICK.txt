# Fix Applied - Build Error Resolved

## What Was Fixed

Root `package.json` build script updated:

**Before:** `"build": "cd client && npm run build"`  
**After:** `"build": "echo \"Backend build (frontend is deployed separately to Vercel)\""`

This prevents Railway from trying to build the React frontend when deploying the Node backend.

---

## Deploy Now

### 1. Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway build - remove frontend build from root package.json"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Railway
- Dashboard → Backend Service → Deployments → Redeploy
- Or push will trigger automatic redeploy

### 3. Expected Result
Railway logs will show:
```
✓ Building...
✓ npm install
✓ Starting...
✓ Server running on port [PORT]
✓ MongoDB connected
✅ SUCCESS
```

---

## Verify After Deploy

```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"Server is running"}
```

**Frontend (Vercel):** Untouched ✅  
**Backend (Railway):** Ready ✅  
**Build Error:** Fixed ✅
